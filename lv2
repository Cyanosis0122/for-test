#It's funny how the music put times in perspective
#Add a soundtrack to your life and perfect it
Whenever you are feeling blue keep walking and we can get far
Wherever you are
It's funny how the music put times in perspective
Add a soundtrack to your life and perfect it
Whenever you are feeling blue keep walking and we can get far
Wherever you are
Like a movie that you can't predict
Like a book that you can't resist
I sing along a song that's oh so sensual
Bring along a sip to make it all so sexual
Verbally that is
Making love to the music means vibing to the beat at night
With the whole city fast asleep, out cold
True words seem to rise to the lips, take hold
Of a poet in me, most powerfully
I feel free when the world doesn't owe it to me
It's so hard to find a gig that lives up to the billing
Trying to find a reason to work, god willing
I admit, my thinking is wishful
Like a star upon a child gazing up to the ceiling
How far do we have to stretch the truth
To fit the lifestyles borrowed and overdue
We can take it all back to the register
And start all over from the canister
Let's break it all down into pieces of bright
Moments that pass by like a meteorite
Throw on your favorite reel that's good to go
On the analog player watch the people glow
Sit back to the breeze let the memories flow
Comedy tragedy all the highs and lows#
